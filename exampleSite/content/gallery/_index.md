This responsive image gallery is rendered in random order from a folder of image files. It uses Hugo's [Image Processing](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/) to automatically resize your images while preserving the full size image's aspect ratio. You can configure the gallery to open the full size image file when clicked, or not. You can set this text in the `_index.md` file in the `/content/gallery/` folder.

By the way, [Victoria](https://victoria.dev) took these photos while traveling. You can find some of them on [her nomad blog](https://heronebag.com).
